# ListFilter

This is a experimental test for learn Elixir. Based on @rocketseat.

In this challenge, you must create a new project with a function that, given a list of strings that represent numbers or not (example `["1", "3", "6", "43", "banana", "6 ", "abc"]`), filter all numeric elements in the list and return how many odd numbers there are in that list.

We can follow the expected result by observing the following example of function execution:

```bash
iex> ListFilter.call(["1", "3", "6", "43", "banana", "6", "abc"])
...> 3
```
